![Construction Barricade](image/under-construction-flashing-barricade-animation-1.gif)

Just playing around with gtkmm-4 examples.

The .bashrc file at the top level of this project contains a snippet to be appended to the user's `~/.bashrc` file. Once that's done the following is possible:

```
create <PROJECT_NAME>
...
compile <PROJECT_NAME>
...
run <PROJECT_NAME>
...
```

## BE WARNED!

This project is under construction! Don't expect it to actually work!
